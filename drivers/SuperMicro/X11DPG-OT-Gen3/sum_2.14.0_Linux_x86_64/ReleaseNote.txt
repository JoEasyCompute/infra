Supermicro Update Manager (SUM) Release Notes
================================================
Software Release Version: V2.14.0
Release Date: 2024/02/15


Introduction
============
The Supermicro Update Manager (SUM) can be used to manage the BIOS/BMC/CMM/PSU/
BBP/RAID/Aoc NIC/GPU/switch/AIP/SCP firmware image update and configuration
update for select systems. In addition, system checks as well as event log
management are also supported.
Moreover, advanced applications are also provided to facilitate system
management. To update configurations, users can edit system BIOS configurations
,DMI information and BMC/RAID/CMM configurations from readable text files, as
well as use this update manager to apply these configurations.

Two channels are possible for management: the OOB (Out-Of-Band) channel, i.e.
communication through the BMC IPMI interface, and the in-band channel, i.e.
communication through the local system interfaces. By the OOB channel, most
management commands (except CheckSystemUtilization) can be executed
independently of the OS on the managed system and even before the system OS
is installed.

   X11SPA and X11SRi-IF. In addition, it is not supported on C7-series
   platforms.
3. For the --reboot option in OOB usage, if the target OS does not support
   software shutdown, system will be forced to power off and on again.
4. With the Server ME embedded on the Supermicro system, the execution of the
   in-band command "UpdateBios" might fail when the Client ME driver (MEIx64)
   is installed on Windows.
5. All commands of CMM Management are for OOB use only.
6. In-band GetBmcCfg/ChangeBmcCfg commands in Windows does not support a
   hostname that exceeds 244 bytes.
7. ChangeBiosCfg command will show error messages if the current BIOS
   configuration is different from the generated BIOS XML configuration file.
8. BIOS XML configuration REQUIRES a text editor supporting extended ASCII
   characters (ISO-8859-1 encoding).
9. The SW-managed JPME2 feature to update FDT in ME region is NOT supported in
   the following MBs: X11DDW-L/N(T) Revision 1.10, X11DPH-T-P Revision 1.00,
   X11DPL-I-P Revision 1.01, X11DPU-X(LL) Revision 1.01.
   Note that the earlier revisions of those four MBs are not supported neither.
10.The TpmProvision command does not support TPM 2.0 on Grantley.
11.A1SRi/A1SAi MB does not support OOB BIOS update.
12.The TpmProvision command does not support on the platforms after Purley.

21.In-band update BIOS through KCS does not support on AMI platform.
22.In-band UpdateBios/UpdateBmc commands through KCS on Windows require SD5
   removed.
23.While executing UpdateBIOS/In-Band TpmManage commands, manual steps are
   required under some special cases. Instructions will be provided to continue
   these commands.
24.The format mm/dd/yy or mm/dd/yyyy is required for build date in DMI
   information.
25.System will be powered off during update BIOS process on X12/H12 and later
   RoT platforms.
