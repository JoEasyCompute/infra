SuperServer Automation Assistant (SAA) Release Notes
======================================================
Software Release Version: V1.2.0-p5
Release Date: 2025/03/26


Introduction
============
The SuperServer Automation Assistant (SAA) is designed to manage Supermicro
systems. It helps IT administrators to easily manage the firmware image update
and configuration update on the firmware of a system, including BIOS/BMC/CMM/
PSU/BBP/RAID/Aoc NIC/GPU/switch/AIP/SCP. In addition, system checks as well as
event log management are also supported.
Moreover, advanced applications are also provided to facilitate system
management. To update configurations, users can edit system BIOS configurations
,DMI information and BMC/RAID/CMM configurations from readable text files, as
well as use this update manager to apply these configurations.

The SAA supports either Redfish or IPMI, or both industry standards for system
management, it varies depending on the BMC of each generation platform. Users
are able to manage BMC-based systems in the remote console through out-of-band
(OOB) channel or in the local host through in-band channel. It also provides
one-to-many configuration management for mass deployment and management.

Known Limitation
================
1. For the --reboot option in OOB usage, if the target OS does not support
   software shutdown, system will be forced to power off and on again.
2. With the Server ME embedded on the Supermicro system, the execution of the
   in-band command "UpdateBios" might fail when the Client ME driver (MEIx64)
   is installed on Windows.
3. All commands of CMM Management are for OOB use only.
4. In-band GetBmcCfg/ChangeBmcCfg commands in Windows does not support a
   hostname that exceeds 244 bytes.
5. ChangeBiosCfg command will show error messages if the current BIOS
   configuration is different from the generated BIOS XML configuration file.
6. BIOS XML configuration REQUIRES a text editor supporting extended ASCII
   characters (ISO-8859-1 encoding).
7. The UpdatePsu command only supports PSU "PWS-2K04A-1R" and "PWS-2K20A-1R" by
   OEM request.
8. In-Band UpdateBmc command on FreeBSD OS will be slow caused by KCS driver
   of FreeBSD.
9. TUI does not support mouse operation.
10.LAN table in BMC configuration file is read-only for OOB usage if BMC does
   not support REDFISH.
11.The format mm/dd/yy or mm/dd/yyyy is required for build date in DMI
   information.
12.System will be powered off during update BIOS process on X12/H12 and later
   RoT platforms.
13.When dynamic enabling USB port by SetUsbAccessMode command, USB 3.0 device
   may need to manually unplug and plug to be available.
14.For BMC configuration commands, when next boot is set to UEFI Shell with
   unsupported BIOS, the system will be booted into BIOS Setup instead.
15.When activating JSON format node product key in Windows, the JSON product key
   string cannot contain space character.
16.The option --post_complete is designed to wait for system POST complete and
   requires both BMC and BIOS support. When only BMC supports, even if the
   system completes POST procedures, SAA still waits for system POST complete
   until timeout.
17.In-band update BIOS from BIOS version 1.x to 2.x or downgrade from 2.x to 1.x
   on H12 non-RoT systems through SMI is not supported.
18.Mount ISO through IPv6 feature does not support on H12 AST2500 non-RoT.
19.All In-band commands through KCS on Windows require SD5 removed.
20.SetUsbAccessMode and GetUsbAccessMode commands do not work when Linux kernel
   configuration CONFIG_STRICT_DEVMEM is configured as y(yes).
21.SuperDiag command --file option is only supported on Windows.
22.When assigning the SAA arguments in command line, please be aware of the
   escape characters.
